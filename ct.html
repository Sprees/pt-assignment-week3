        <h2>About the Continental Divide Trail</h2>
        <p>
          The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (in short Continental
          Divide Trail, CDT) is a United States National Scenic Trail with a
          length measured by the Continental Divide Trail Coalition of 3,028
          miles (4,873 km) between the U.S. border with Chihuahua, Mexico and
          the border with Alberta, Canada. Frequent route changes and a large
          number of alternate routes result in an actual hiking distance of
          2,700 miles (4,300 km) to 3,150 miles (5,070 km). The CDT follows the
          Continental Divide of the Americas along the Rocky Mountains and
          traverses five U.S. states â€” Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and
          New Mexico. In Montana near the Canadian border the trail crosses
          Triple Divide Pass (near Triple Divide Peak, from which waters may
          flow to either the Arctic Ocean (via Hudson Bay), Atlantic Ocean or
          Pacific Ocean).
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, the CDT was about 70 percent complete, with a combination of
          dedicated trails and dirt and paved roads. Hikers can continue north
          into Alberta and British Columbia via the Great Divide Trail to Kakwa
          Lake in Kakwa Provincial Park and Protected Area, B.C., north of
          Jasper National Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CDT was described in 2013 by a Triple Crown hiker as "Raw, wild,
          remote and unfinished; it is a trail that will make use of all the
          skills of an experienced backpacker. It is also a trail that is
          beautiful, stunning and perhaps the most rewarding of the major
          long-distance hiking trails." Distances given are approximate as
          sections of the trail are uncompleted and the trail is sometimes
          re-routed.

        <h2>Hiking the Continental Divide Trail</h2>
        <p>
          Successfully thru-hiking the entire Continental Divide Trail takes an
          average of five months. The definition of a thru-hike is left to the
          judgment of the hikers. The purists hike a "continuous and unbroken
          footpath between Mexico and Canada," but about 50 percent of the
          thru-hikers admit to having skipped small sections of road-walking or
          because the trail was closed, mostly due to forest fires or snow. All
          hikers must replenish their food every few days, often hitchhiking
          from a road crossing of the trail into a town to buy food and
          supplies. Most hikers occasionally take a "zero", a day without
          hiking, or a "nero", a day with little hiking, to rest and recuperate.
          "Trail angels" (volunteers) at locations along the trail assist hikers
          with food, water, and transportation to and from resupply points to
          trail heads. A few hikers, especially those attempting to set speed
          records, are "supported," meaning they have helpers who meet or
          accompany them along the trail and perform non-hiking tasks, such as
          food preparation. Permits are required to hike or camp along some
          sections of the trail and a passport is needed to cross the Canadian
          border.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most thru-hikers begin the hike in April in New Mexico, hike
          northbound, and finish at the Canadian border in August or September.
          If hikers begin too early they may encounter heavy and near impassable
          snow conditions in the southern San Juan and San Juan Mountains of
          Colorado, and if the hiker finishes too late they may encounter heavy
          and near impassable snow in Glacier National Park near the Canadian
          border. A few thru-hikers hike southbound (SOBO) from the Canadian
          border beginning in June and finishing in October or November. They
          may also encounter adverse weather conditions. A few hikers
          "flip-flop," hiking different sections of the trail when the weather
          is most favorable rather than sequentially. The most common problems
          reported by thru-hikers are injury and snow. The average base weight
          of a thru-hiker's backpack in 2018 was 16.4 lb (7.4 kg). Added to
          that, the thru-hiker carries up to a one-week supply of food weighing
          about 2 lb (0.91 kg) per day and, in drier areas especially New
          Mexico, up to five liters of water weighing 11 lb (5.0 kg). Extra
          equipment carried might include an ice ax and bear spray.
