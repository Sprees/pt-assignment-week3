              <p class="card-text">
                The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (in short Continental
                Divide Trail, CDT) is a United States National Scenic Trail with a
                length measured by the Continental Divide Trail Coalition of 3,028
                miles (4,873 km) between the U.S. border with Chihuahua, Mexico and
                the border with Alberta, Canada. Frequent route changes and a large
                number of alternate routes result in an actual hiking distance of
                2,700 miles (4,300 km) to 3,150 miles (5,070 km). The CDT follows the
                Continental Divide of the Americas along the Rocky Mountains and
                traverses five U.S. states â€” Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and
                New Mexico. In Montana near the Canadian border the trail crosses
                Triple Divide Pass (near Triple Divide Peak, from which waters may
                flow to either the Arctic Ocean (via Hudson Bay), Atlantic Ocean or
                Pacific Ocean).
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                In 2021, the CDT was about 70 percent complete, with a combination of
                dedicated trails and dirt and paved roads. Hikers can continue north
                into Alberta and British Columbia via the Great Divide Trail to Kakwa
                Lake in Kakwa Provincial Park and Protected Area, B.C., north of
                Jasper National Park.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The CDT was described in 2013 by a Triple Crown hiker as "Raw, wild,
                remote and unfinished; it is a trail that will make use of all the
                skills of an experienced backpacker. It is also a trail that is
                beautiful, stunning and perhaps the most rewarding of the major
                long-distance hiking trails." Distances given are approximate as
                sections of the trail are uncompleted and the trail is sometimes
                re-routed.

              <p class="card-text">
                Successfully thru-hiking the entire Continental Divide Trail takes an
                average of five months. The definition of a thru-hike is left to the
                judgment of the hikers. The purists hike a "continuous and unbroken
                footpath between Mexico and Canada," but about 50 percent of the
                thru-hikers admit to having skipped small sections of road-walking or
                because the trail was closed, mostly due to forest fires or snow. All
                hikers must replenish their food every few days, often hitchhiking
                from a road crossing of the trail into a town to buy food and
                supplies. Most hikers occasionally take a "zero", a day without
                hiking, or a "nero", a day with little hiking, to rest and recuperate.
                "Trail angels" (volunteers) at locations along the trail assist hikers
                with food, water, and transportation to and from resupply points to
                trail heads. A few hikers, especially those attempting to set speed
                records, are "supported," meaning they have helpers who meet or
                accompany them along the trail and perform non-hiking tasks, such as
                food preparation. Permits are required to hike or camp along some
                sections of the trail and a passport is needed to cross the Canadian
                border.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Most thru-hikers begin the hike in April in New Mexico, hike
                northbound, and finish at the Canadian border in August or September.
                If hikers begin too early they may encounter heavy and near impassable
                snow conditions in the southern San Juan and San Juan Mountains of
                Colorado, and if the hiker finishes too late they may encounter heavy
                and near impassable snow in Glacier National Park near the Canadian
                border. A few thru-hikers hike southbound (SOBO) from the Canadian
                border beginning in June and finishing in October or November. They
                may also encounter adverse weather conditions. A few hikers
                "flip-flop," hiking different sections of the trail when the weather
                is most favorable rather than sequentially. The most common problems
                reported by thru-hikers are injury and snow. The average base weight
                of a thru-hiker's backpack in 2018 was 16.4 lb (7.4 kg). Added to
                that, the thru-hiker carries up to a one-week supply of food weighing
                about 2 lb (0.91 kg) per day and, in drier areas especially New
                Mexico, up to five liters of water weighing 11 lb (5.0 kg). Extra
                equipment carried might include an ice ax and bear spray.
