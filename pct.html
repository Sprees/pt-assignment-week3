        <h2>About the Pacific Crest Trail</h2>
        <p>
          The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), officially designated as the Pacific
          Crest National Scenic Trail, is a long-distance hiking and equestrian
          trail closely aligned with the highest portion of the Cascade and
          Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, which lie 100 to 150 miles (160 to 240
          km) east of the U.S. Pacific coast. The trail's southern terminus is
          next to the Mexico–United States border, just south of Campo,
          California, and its northern terminus is on the Canada–US border, upon
          which it continues unofficially to the Windy Joe Trail within Manning
          Park in British Columbia; it passes through the states of California,
          Oregon, and Washington.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pacific Crest Trail is 2,653 mi (4,270 km) long and ranges in
          elevation from roughly 110 feet (34 m) above sea level near the Bridge
          of the Gods on the Oregon–Washington border to 13,153 feet (4,009 m)
          at Forester Pass in the Sierra Nevada. The route passes through 25
          national forests and 7 national parks. Its midpoint is near Chester,
          California (near Mt. Lassen), where the Sierra and Cascade mountain
          ranges meet. The overall elevation gain for the Pacific Crest Trail is
          approximately 489,000 ft (149,000 m).

          It was designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, although it was not
          officially completed until 1993. The PCT was conceived by Clinton
          Churchill Clarke in 1932. It received official status under the
          National Trails System Act of 1968.

        <h2>Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail</h2>
        <p>
          While most hikers travel from the southern terminus at the Mexico–US
          border northward to Manning Park, British Columbia, some hikers prefer
          a southbound route. In a normal weather year, northbound hikes are
          most practical due to snow and temperature considerations.
          Additionally, some hiker services are seasonal and may be better timed
          for northbound hikers. If snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is high in
          early June and low in the Northern Cascades, some hikers may choose to
          'flip-flop.' Flip-flopping can take many forms but often describes a
          process whereby a hiker begins at one end (on the PCT, usually the
          southern end) of the trail and then, at some point, like reaching the
          Sierra, 'flips' to the end of the trail at the Canada–US border and
          hikes southbound to complete the trail. However, it is not currently
          possible to legally enter the United States from Canada by using the
          Pacific Crest Trail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hikers also have to determine their resupply points. Resupply points
          are towns or post offices where hikers replenish food and other
          supplies such as cooking fuel. Hikers can ship packages to themselves
          at the U.S. Post Offices along the trail, resupply at general and
          grocery stores along the trail, or any combination of the two. The
          final major logistical step is to create an approximate schedule for
          completion. Thru hikers have to make sure they complete enough miles
          every day to reach the opposite end of the trail before weather
          conditions make sections impassable. For northbound thru-hikers, deep
          snow pack in the Sierra Nevada can prevent an early start. The timing
          is a balance between not getting to the Sierra too soon nor the
          Northern Cascades too late. Most hikers cover about 20 miles (32 km)
          per day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to reduce their hiking time and thereby increase their
          chances of completing the trail, many hikers try to substantially
          reduce their pack weight. Since the creation of the Pacific Crest
          Trail there has been a large movement by hikers to get away from large
          heavy packs with a lot of gear. There are three general
          classifications for hikers: Traditional, Lightweight, and Ultralight.
