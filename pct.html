              <p class="card-text">
                The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), officially designated as the Pacific
                Crest National Scenic Trail, is a long-distance hiking and equestrian
                trail closely aligned with the highest portion of the Cascade and
                Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, which lie 100 to 150 miles (160 to 240
                km) east of the U.S. Pacific coast. The trail's southern terminus is
                next to the Mexico–United States border, just south of Campo,
                California, and its northern terminus is on the Canada–US border, upon
                which it continues unofficially to the Windy Joe Trail within Manning
                Park in British Columbia; it passes through the states of California,
                Oregon, and Washington.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The Pacific Crest Trail is 2,653 mi (4,270 km) long and ranges in
                elevation from roughly 110 feet (34 m) above sea level near the Bridge
                of the Gods on the Oregon–Washington border to 13,153 feet (4,009 m)
                at Forester Pass in the Sierra Nevada. The route passes through 25
                national forests and 7 national parks. Its midpoint is near Chester,
                California (near Mt. Lassen), where the Sierra and Cascade mountain
                ranges meet. The overall elevation gain for the Pacific Crest Trail is
                approximately 489,000 ft (149,000 m).

                It was designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, although it was not
                officially completed until 1993. The PCT was conceived by Clinton
                Churchill Clarke in 1932. It received official status under the
                National Trails System Act of 1968.

              <p class="card-text">
                While most hikers travel from the southern terminus at the Mexico–US
                border northward to Manning Park, British Columbia, some hikers prefer
                a southbound route. In a normal weather year, northbound hikes are
                most practical due to snow and temperature considerations.
                Additionally, some hiker services are seasonal and may be better timed
                for northbound hikers. If snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is high in
                early June and low in the Northern Cascades, some hikers may choose to
                'flip-flop.' Flip-flopping can take many forms but often describes a
                process whereby a hiker begins at one end (on the PCT, usually the
                southern end) of the trail and then, at some point, like reaching the
                Sierra, 'flips' to the end of the trail at the Canada–US border and
                hikes southbound to complete the trail. However, it is not currently
                possible to legally enter the United States from Canada by using the
                Pacific Crest Trail.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Hikers also have to determine their resupply points. Resupply points
                are towns or post offices where hikers replenish food and other
                supplies such as cooking fuel. Hikers can ship packages to themselves
                at the U.S. Post Offices along the trail, resupply at general and
                grocery stores along the trail, or any combination of the two. The
                final major logistical step is to create an approximate schedule for
                completion. Thru hikers have to make sure they complete enough miles
                every day to reach the opposite end of the trail before weather
                conditions make sections impassable. For northbound thru-hikers, deep
                snow pack in the Sierra Nevada can prevent an early start. The timing
                is a balance between not getting to the Sierra too soon nor the
                Northern Cascades too late. Most hikers cover about 20 miles (32 km)
                per day.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                In order to reduce their hiking time and thereby increase their
                chances of completing the trail, many hikers try to substantially
                reduce their pack weight. Since the creation of the Pacific Crest
                Trail there has been a large movement by hikers to get away from large
                heavy packs with a lot of gear. There are three general
                classifications for hikers: Traditional, Lightweight, and Ultralight.
