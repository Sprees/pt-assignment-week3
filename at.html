        <h2>About the Appalachian Trail</h2>
        <p>
          The Appalachian Trail, also called the A.T., is a hiking trail in the
          Eastern United States, extending almost 2,200 miles (3,540 km) between
          Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine, and passing
          through 14 states. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy claims the
          Appalachian Trail to be the world's longest hiking-only trail. More
          than three million people hike segments of it each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trail was first proposed in 1921 and completed in 1937.
          Improvements and changes have continued since then. It became the
          Appalachian National Scenic Trail under the National Trails System Act
          of 1968.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thru-hikers walk the entire trail in a single season. The number of
          thru-hikes per year has increased steadily since 2010, with 715
          northbound and 133 southbound thru-hikes reported in 2017. The
          Appalachian Trail Conservancy estimates there are over 3,000 attempts
          to traverse the entire trail each year, about 25% of which succeed.
          Many books, documentaries, and websites are dedicated to the pursuit.
          Some hike from one end to the other, then turn around and thru-hike
          the other way, a "yo-yo".

          Throughout its length, the AT is marked by white paint blazes that are
          2 by 6 inches (5 by 15 cm). Side trails to shelters, viewpoints and
          parking areas use similarly shaped blue blazes. In past years, some
          sections of the trail also used metal diamond markers with the AT
          logo.
        </p>

          Most hikers carry a lightweight tent, tent hammock or tarp. The trail
          has more than 250 shelters and campsites available for hikers. The
          shelters, sometimes called lean-tos (in Maine, Massachusetts, and
          Connecticut), huts (in Shenandoah National Park), or Adirondack
          shelters, are generally open, three-walled structures with a wooden
          floor, although some shelters are much more complex in structure.
          Shelters are usually spaced a day's hike or less apart, most often
          near a water source (which may be dry) and with a privy. They
          generally have spaces for tent sites in the vicinity as the shelters
          may be full. The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) operates a system of
          eight huts along 56 miles (90 km) of New Hampshire's White Mountains.
          These huts are significantly larger than standard trail shelters and
          offer full-service lodging and meals during the summer months. The
          Fontana Dam Shelter in North Carolina is more commonly referred to as
          the Fontana Hilton because of amenities (e.g. flushable toilets) and
          its proximity to an all-you-can-eat buffet and post office. Several
          AMC huts have an extended self-service season during the fall, with
          two extending self-service seasons through the winter and spring. The
          Potomac Appalachian Trail Club maintains trail cabins, shelters, and
          huts throughout the Shenandoah region of Virginia.

          Trail hikers who attempt to complete the entire trail in a single
          season are called "thru-hikers"; those who traverse the trail during a
          series of separate trips are known as "section-hikers". Rugged
          terrain, weather extremes, illness, injury, and the time and effort
          required make thru-hiking difficult to accomplish. As of 2017, the
          Appalachian Trail Conservancy estimated that 3,839 hikers set out from
          Springer Mountain, northbound, 497 from Mount Katahdin, southbound,
          and reported 1,186 completions of hiking the entire trail, which
          includes those by both section and through hikers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most thru-hikers walk northward from Georgia to Maine, and generally
          start out in early spring and follow the warm weather as it moves
          north. These "north-bounders" are also called NOBO (NOrthBOund) or
          GAME (Georgia(GA)-to-Maine(ME)), while those heading in the opposite
          direction are termed "south-bounders" (also SOBO or MEGA).
        </p>
        <p>
          A thru-hike generally requires five to seven months, although some
          have done it in three months, and several trail runners have completed
          the trail in less time. Trail runners typically tackle the AT with
          automobile support teams, without backpacks, and without camping in
          the woods.
